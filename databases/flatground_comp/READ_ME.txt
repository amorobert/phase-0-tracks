#########################For those unfamiliar with the game... 
S.K.A.T.E is like the skateboarding version of the basketball game H.O.R.S.E. 
In H.O.R.S.E the first player shoots a basket from any spot, then the other person must shoot from the same spot. 
They recieve a letter if they miss. If the person setting the shot misses the other player gets to choose a spot to shoot from. 
S.K.A.T.E works the same way essentially except replace shots with skateboard tricks. 
Generally is is played using only flip or flatground tricks (i.e no rails or ramps).
Tricks can't be repeated in a single game once theyv'e been landed.
Here is a short game for example.
